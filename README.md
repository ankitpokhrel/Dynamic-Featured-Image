}
add_filter('dfi_post_types', 'allowed_post_types');

```
function blocked_post_types() {
    return array('page'); //block DFI in page
}
add_filter('dfi_post_type_user_filter', 'blocked_post_types');
```

### Changing the metabox default text
Use `dfi_set_metabox_title` filter to change the metabox default title (Featured Image)
```
function set_metabox_title( $title ) {
    return "My custom metabox title";
}
add_filter('dfi_set_metabox_title', 'set_metabox_title');
```

### Translation Guidelines
All translations live in the `languages` folder.

If you are interested in translating the plugin in your language, first make sure if the translation is not already available. The name of the file is important because there’s a particular format you should follow for consistency. For example, if you’re translating Nepali for Nepal, the file should be `dynamic-featured-image-ne_NP.po` – `dynamic-featured-image` for the plugin itself, `ne` for the language and `NP` for the country.
